# EvilnoVNC
**EvilnoVNC** is a Ready to go Phishing Platform. 

Unlike other phishing techniques, EvilnoVNC allows 2FA bypassing by using a real browser over a noVNC connection.

In addition, this tool allows us to see in real time all of the victim's actions, access to their downloaded files and the entire browser profile, including cookies, saved passwords, browsing history and much more.


# Requirements

# Mods made in Fork
1. vnc_lite.html
    - Added javascript to automatically redirect to another page when websocket connection is disconnected
    - Manually changed the tab title using javascript

2. startVNC.sh
    - Enabled remote debugging port for chrome and expose it to port 9223 using socat

3. start.sh
    - Exposed port 9223 for chrome debugging in docker run command

4. Dockerfile
    - Installed iproute2 to enable connection debugging in docker container if needed

5. Added bash scripts for easier execution
    - **build.sh:** For building the container image
    - **killconnection.sh:** Manually disconnects a victims websocket connection (If using a reverse proxy, the victim's websocket connection can be traced via ss and using the proxy's ip address. Modify as needed to your setup)
    - **exportsession.sh:** Runs a script to export the chrome session storage data thru the chrome debugging port. Requires pychrome library to run. Scripts are located in the chromedebug directory.
